Welcome to this Demo repo!

Intro
-----
This is my private repository to store the documents I'm currently working on. The docs are saved in the format <doc_name>-<version>-<your_name>. For example, "Readme-01-AA.md"

You can contribute to this repo by reviewing existing or adding your documents.

1. When you review existing docs, save a new version of the doc and add your initials to it. 
2. When you add your own docs, save them in the format as described above.  
3. Refer to [Microsoft Style Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/) for style and terminology.
